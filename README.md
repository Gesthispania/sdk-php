The NimblePayments SDK for PHP makes it easy to add payment services to your e-commerce. It connects your site to the NimblePayments API directly.

## Release notes

- Restructuring code
- Implementating new API services
- Test example code

### 1.0.0

## Installation
The SDK zip from the GitHub repository contains the NimblePayments SDK for PHP tool, including all its dependencies. Follow the next steps to install it:

1. Download the latest/desired release zip. You will obtain a file called "_sdk-php-master.zip_" which includes the SDK and several samples.
2. Create a new folder inside your PHP project directory to store NimblePayments SDK files.
3. Unzip "_sdk-php-master.zip_" and copy all files in the folder you have just created in the previous step.

## Configuration
The file named __base/ConfigSDK.php__ includes some configuration parameters by default that do not need to be modified.

## Working with the SDK
Once you have completed the Installation and configuration processes, you are ready to generate a payment.

## Payments 
In order to execute a payment, you will need to create a `NimbleApi` instance with payment and client information and use the `SendPaymentClient` method in the class `Payments` to send the payment

### Payment’s information
A `payment` term refers to an object that contains all the data needed in order to execute a payment. This object is an array that must be filled with the following parameters:

- `amount`: it refers to the amount that has to be paid in cents avoiding the decimal digits. The real amount has to be multiplied by 100.
- `currency`: it refers to the payment currency. It follows the currency ISO 4217 code
- `customerData`: it refers to the merchant's sale identification. Example: The Prestashop`s order id.
- `paymentSuccessUrl`: it refers to the callback URL to be redirected when the payment finishes successfully.
- `paymentErrorUrl`: it refers to the callback URL to be redirected when the payment finishes with an error.

```php
require_once './sdk-php/lib/Nimble/base/NimbleAPI.php';

// build an array with payment information
$payment = array(
         'amount' => 1010,
         'currency' => 'EUR',
         'customerData' => 'idSample12345',
         'paymentSuccessUrl' => 'https://my-commerce.com/payments/success',
         'paymentErrorUrl' => 'https://my-commerce.com/payments/error'
        );
```

## Client’s  information
Client information refers to an array called “params” that includes client’s credentials and ‘mode’ parameters.

- Client’s credentials consist of a clientid and clientsecret. Their value is the  `Api_Client_Id` and the `Client_Secret` codes  generated when creating a Payment gateway in the Nimble dashboard.
- `mode` parameter defines the environment in which you want to work. It has two possible values:
    - `sandbox`. It is used in the demo environment to make tests.
    - `real`. It is used to work in the real environment.

## Example of a Payment generation
To generate a Payment you will need to execute the following steps:

- Build an array with the payment information
- Build an array with client information (`Api_Client_Id` and `Client_Secret`) and mode parameters
- Create a `NimbleAPI` instance
- Use the `SendPaymentClient` method in the class `Payments` to send the payment

```php
require_once './sdk-php/lib/Nimble/base/NimbleAPI.php';

// build an array with payment information
$payment = array(
         'amount' => 1010,
         'currency' => 'EUR',
         'customerData' => 'idSample12345',
         'paymentSuccessUrl' => 'https://my-commerce.com/payments/success',
         'paymentErrorUrl' => 'https://my-commerce.com/payments/error'
        );

// build an array with client API information
$params = array(
        'clientId' => '729DFCD7A2B4643A0DA3D4A7E537FC6E',
        'clientSecret' => 'jg26cI3O1mB0$eR&fo6a2TWPmq&gyQoUOG6tClO%VE*N$SN9xX27@R4CTqi*$4EO'
);

$NimbleApi = new NimbleAPI($params);
$response = Payments::SendPaymentClient($NimbleApi, $payment);
```

## Test

In `test` folder you will find scripts implementing a basics operations that uses NimbleePayments SDK as payment platform.
